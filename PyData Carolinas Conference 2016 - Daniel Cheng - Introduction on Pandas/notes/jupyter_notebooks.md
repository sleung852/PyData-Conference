The interface I used during the tutorial was in the `jupyter notebook`.

There were some other cool things about the notebook that I did not get to cover
(sorry I ran out of time).

# Cells

Each bit of code I typed was inside a "cell".
By default the cell type is `code'.
However, if you click on a cell, there will be a dropdown that will let you change it to other cell types.

The one I want to bring attention to is the `markdown` cell.

Markdown is shorthand HTML.
Meaning you can have **text like this** and not have to write a bunch of `html` code.

If you want to learn more about markdown here are some resources:

1. https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
2. https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

**Why would you want to use markdown in a notebook?**
This allows you to have code, output, as well as regular prose to explain/interpret results.
It's pretty cool.
The concenpt of haveing code/output/prose is called *literate programming*.
It's great for generating reports and reproducibility.

You can also write `LaTeX` formulas in the jupyter notebook markdown cells,
simply put your equations around dollar signs (e.g., `$y = mx + b$`)


*Thanks Bailee Christopher for reminding me to cover/mention this*
