# Tutorial Objective

Let's start doing our data analysis **not** in a spreadsheet program and learn Python and Pandas along the way.

Don't get me wrong, I use spreadsheets, but not for data analysis.

Also, there are some notes from people who I've talked to during the conference in the `notes` folder.
Click the `.md` file, and github will render the document on the website (like this `README.md` file you are reading now).

# Setup

The easiest way to get everything you need to the tutorial is to install `anaconda`

You can download and install it here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

I will be using the Python 3 version during the tutorial.

*I actually ended up using Python 2 because of I had a last minute computer change*

## Install seaborn for plotting

`conda install seaborn`

# Data

1. Gapminder: https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/raw/master/inst/gapminder.tsv
